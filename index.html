                I am kinda hesitant to share anything about myself so I will let the AI tell what it thinks of me... <br>

            <p>Naic lies in the outskirts of Cavite... 
                the first province of the South of Manila, Philippines. 
                It sits where the beach meets the mountain. 
                In our town proper, you will see the two headed carabao.
                This represents two faces or characteristic where one is rebel (facing up) and the other is reformed (facing down).
